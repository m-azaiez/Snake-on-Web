🐍 Snake (Web Version)

🎮 About the Project

This is a simple web-based implementation of the classic Snake game.

The project was created purely for fun and experimentation. Its purpose is recreational: to practice JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and basic game mechanics in the browser.

It is not intended to be a production-level game, but rather a small personal project built to learn, explore, and enjoy coding.
